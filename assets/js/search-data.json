This is honestly a more extravegant purchase that I would generally care to make, but they needed a way to get out a lot of pent up energy at home. So enter the bounce house. They jump, my wife and I keep some sanity. It mostly works. Except on the days when they “really want to jump” and decide they are done after 5 minutes. .",
