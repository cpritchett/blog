I'm Chad Pritchett, and this is my blog.  I'm an IT Guy, usually you'll find me leading teams of talented engineers keeping *The Cloud* afloat.  This is where I post technical projects, scale models that I've built, pictures my kids have drawn, and maybe a recipe or two. 

If you're interested in my CV/resume, there's always linkedin:
